- Don't import itcl::* into the global namespace.

- Bugfix: recursive type marshalling was non-compliant.
- Bugfix: don't get stuck in an infinite loop when failing to connect

  "stringified object reference" for what was previously called "object
  reference."  Also rename "pseudo object" to "local object."
