These are recommendations, not all of the same priority, and not
all necessarily will be implemented.  If you see something you
feel is important, email me and say so.  Very democratic.

* some sort of textbbox command that will return the size of the
  text in a cell, to allow for perfect cell sizing.

* anchor title areas in different parts of the screen

* -rowstretchmode fill ignores initial # of rows, or config requests for more.
* interpret 0 rows/cols to be FILL
* add -colstretchmode fill
* scratch stretchmode "fill" in favor of "dynamic" which would monitor
  the max extent of row/col (difficult)

* fix selection routines to properly handle title area movement

* support smooth scrolling of rows/cols
 
* add ability to index by tagname
* overhaul tag mechanism (include way to query for tags on a cell, add
  priority)

* add internal sort procedures
pathName  sort	-row	{the list of rows we want to sort | all}
		-col	{the list of cols we use for sorting}
		-master row,col
		-command _command_to_use_
		-type	{for each column specifies the type of sort:
			ascii | dictionary | integer | real }
		-order	{for each column specify the order of sort:
			increasing | decreasing | none }

* row/column swap (maybe only in terms of visual remapping)

MAJOR:

Sol2.5.1/gcc 2.8.1 && WinNT/VC++5
seg fault when you exit Tk without destroying or withdrawing
the table first.  Dies trying to reference TableEventProc.
Problem seems to be that TableEventProc gets unloaded before it can
be called when not used in the primary interpreter, or used as a
loadable library.  FIXED with hack that creates ExitHandler for each
instance of table to make sure it is destroyed before Tcl exits.
The finalization code is fixed in Tk8.1final and Tk8.0.5+.

A span that cover the last (end) cell doesn't draw correctly.

MINOR:

Windows: With "-colstretchmode last", the scrollbar behaves oddly in
	handling the space for the last cell properly when moving the
	main part of the scrollbar with the mouse.  This seems to be
	that even though the scrollbar receives the "set 0.6xxx 1",
	the scrollbar immediately jumps back to what the mouse says,
	although this isn't a problem in X...

Windows: when moving windows in "Show Window While Dragging" mode,
	the column titles don't refresh properly.
