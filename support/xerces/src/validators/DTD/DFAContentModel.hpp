//  NOTE:   Upstream work insures that this guy will never see a content model
//          with PCDATA in it. Any model with PCDATA is 'mixed' and is handled
//          via the MixedContentModel class, since mixed models are very
//          constrained in form and easily handled via a special case. This
//          also makes our life much easier here.

    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    //  Private data members
    //
    //  fElemDecl
    //      The element decl object of the element that this is the content
    //      model for. Its just stored here to avoid passing it around all
    //      over the place while building up the DFA.
    //
    //  fElemMap
    //  fElemMapSize
    //      This is the map of unique input symbol elements to indices into
    //      each state's per-input symbol transition table entry. This is part
    //      of the built DFA information that must be kept around to do the
    //      actual validation.
    //
    //  fEmptyOk
    //      This is an optimization. While building the transition table we
    //      can see whether this content model would approve of an empty
    //      content (which could happen if everything was optional.) So we
    //      set this flag and short circuit that check, which would otherwise
    //      be ugly and time consuming if we tried to determine it at each
    //      validation call.
    //
    //  fEOCPos
    //      The NFA position of the special EOC (end of content) node. This
    //      is saved away since its used during the DFA build.
    //
    //  fFinalStateFlags
    //      This is an array of booleans, one per state (there are
    //      fTransTableSize states in the DFA) that indicates whether that
    //      state is a final state.
    //
    //  fFollowList
    //      The list of follow positions for each NFA position (i.e. for each
    //      non-epsilon leaf node.) This is only used during the building of
    //      the DFA, and is let go afterwards.
    //
    //  fHeadNode
    //      This is the head node of our intermediate representation. It is
    //      only non-null during the building of the DFA (just so that it
    //      does not have to be passed all around.) Once the DFA is built,
    //      this is no longer required so its deleted.
    //
    //  fIsAmbiguous
    //      This flag is set during construction if the content model is
    //      ambiguous. This will be used by the scanner to report an error
    //      and is available for later perusal if required.
    //
    //  fLeafCount
    //      The count of leaf nodes. This is an important number that set some
    //      limits on the sizes of data structures in the DFA process.
    //
    //  fLeafList
    //      An array of non-epsilon leaf nodes, which is used during the DFA
    //      build operation, then dropped. These are just references to nodes
    //      pointed to by fHeadNode, so we don't have to clean them up, just
    //      the actually leaf list array itself needs cleanup.
    //
    //  fSpecNode
    //      The content spec node for the element that this object represents
    //      the content of. This info is needed a good bit so we get it once
    //      and keep it. We don't own it, we just reference it.
    //
    //  fTransTable
    //  fTransTableSize
    //      This is the transition table that is the main by product of all
    //      of the effort here. It is an array of arrays of ints. The first
    //      dimension is the number of states we end up with in the DFA. The
    //      second dimensions is the number of unique elements in the content
    //      model (fElemMapSize). Each entry in the second dimension indicates
    //      the new state given that input for the first dimension's start
    //      state.
    //
    //      The fElemMap array handles mapping from element indexes to
    //      positions in the second dimension of the transition table.
    //
    //      fTransTableSize is the number of valid entries in the transition
    //      table, and in the other related tables such as fFinalStateFlags.
