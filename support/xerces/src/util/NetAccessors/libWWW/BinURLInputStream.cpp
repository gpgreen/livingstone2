/**
 * $Log: BinURLInputStream.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/04/08 04:38:17  kurien
 * XML parser for C++
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/02/26 07:56:36  rahulj
 * Fixed the license header as pointed out by Bill Schindler <developer@bitranch.com>
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/02/17 22:06:19  rahulj
 * Moved the four LibWWW files to its own sub-directory in the
 * NetAccessor directory.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/01/15 01:08:04  rahulj
 * Added support for HTTP to the parser.
 * Error handling is not very good. Also cannot guarantee that
 * there are no memory leaks.
 * Only tested under NT 4.0 SP 5 using libWWW 5.2.8.
