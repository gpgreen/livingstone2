/**
* EntityReference models the XML &entityname; syntax, when used for
* entities defined by the DOM. Entities hardcoded into XML, such as
* character entities, should instead have been translated into text
* by the code which generated the DOM tree.
* <P>
* An XML processor has the alternative of fully expanding Entities
* into the normal document tree. If it does so, no EntityReference nodes
* will appear.
* <P>
* Similarly, non-validating XML processors are not required to read
* or process entity declarations made in the external subset or
* declared in external parameter entities. Hence, some applications
* may not make the replacement value available for Parsed Entities 
* of these types.
* <P>
* EntityReference behaves as a read-only node, and the children of 
* the EntityReference (which reflect those of the Entity, and should
* also be read-only) give its replacement value, if any. They are 
* supposed to automagically stay in synch if the DocumentType is 
* updated with new values for the Entity.
* <P>
* The defined behavior makes efficient storage difficult for the DOM
* implementor. We can't just look aside to the Entity's definition
* in the DocumentType since those nodes have the wrong parent (unless
* we can come up with a clever "imaginary parent" mechanism). We
* must at least appear to clone those children... which raises the
* issue of keeping the reference synchronized with its parent.
* This leads me back to the "cached image of centrally defined data"
* solution, much as I dislike it.
* <P>
* For now I have decided, since REC-DOM-Level-1-19980818 doesn't
* cover this in much detail, that synchronization doesn't have to be
* considered while the user is deep in the tree. That is, if you're
* looking within one of the EntityReferennce's children and the Entity
* changes, you won't be informed; instead, you will continue to access
* the same object -- which may or may not still be part of the tree.
* This is the same behavior that obtains elsewhere in the DOM if the
* subtree you're looking at is deleted from its parent, so it's
* acceptable here. (If it really bothers folks, we could set things
* up so deleted subtrees are walked and marked invalid, but that's
* not part of the DOM's defined behavior.)
* <P>
* As a result, only the EntityReference itself has to be aware of
* changes in the Entity. And it can take advantage of the same
* structure-change-monitoring code I implemented to support
* DeepNodeList.
