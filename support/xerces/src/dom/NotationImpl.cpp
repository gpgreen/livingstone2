/**
* Notations are how the Document Type Description (DTD) records hints
* about the format of an XML "unparsed entity" -- in other words,
* non-XML data bound to this document type, which some applications
* may wish to consult when manipulating the document. A Notation
* represents a name-value pair, with its nodeName being set to the
* declared name of the notation.
* <P>
* Notations are also used to formally declare the "targets" of
* Processing Instructions.
* <P>
* Note that the Notation's data is non-DOM information; the DOM only
* records what and where it is.
* <P>
* See the XML 1.0 spec, sections 4.7 and 2.6, for more info.
* <P>
* Level 1 of the DOM does not support editing Notation contents.
