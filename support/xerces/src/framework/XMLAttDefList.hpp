/**
 *  This class defines an abstract interface that all validators must support.
 *  When the scanner scans the attributes in a start tag, it must have a list
 *  of the defined attributes for that element. This is used to fault in
 *  defaulted and fixed attributes, to know which ones are required, and to
 *  know the their types in order to do the correct normalization.
 *
 *  Since each validator will have its own derivatives of XMLAttDef and will
 *  have its own specialized storage mechanisms for elements and the att
 *  defs that they own, there must be an abstracted way for the scanner to
 *  deal with this list.
 *
 *  It does not derive from the generic Enumerator template class, because
 *  there are portability issues with deriving from a template class in a
 *  DLL. It does though provide a similar enumerator interface.
