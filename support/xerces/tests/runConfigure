# XML parser for C++

# Revision 1.4  2000/02/29 02:19:11  rahulj
# No more compilation errors under HPUX 11.0. We do not build
# DOMMemTest as it crashes the aCC compiler.
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/02/26 07:20:18  rahulj
#  - The threading tests now work on HPUX.
#  - Under HPUX 10.20 we do no build DOMMemTest and DOMTest.
#    It crashes the compiler.
#  - One could not write more worse makefiles than what exists for the
#    tests. Hopefully, I will get bugged enough to fix them oneday.
