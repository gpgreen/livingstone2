    <faq title="What are the differences between Xerces-C and XML4C?">
        <q>What are the differences between Xerces-C and XML4C?</q>
        <a>

            <p>Xerces-C has intrinsic support for ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16
            (Big/Small Endian), UCS4 (Big/Small Endian), EBCDIC code pages IBM037 and
            IBM1140 encodings, ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin1) and Windows-1252. This means that it can parse
            input XML files in these above mentioned encodings.</p>

            <p>However, if you wish to parse XML files in any other
            encodings, say in Shift-JIS, Big5 etc., then you cannot
            use Xerces-C. XML4C addresses this need. It combines Xerces-C
            and <jump
            href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/index.html">
            International Components for Unicode (ICU)</jump> and
            provides support for over 100 different encodings.</p>

            <p>ICU is also an open source project but is licensed
            under the <jump
            href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/license10.html">
            IBM Public License</jump>. XML4C is published by IBM and
            can be downloaded from their <jump
            href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4c">Alphaworks</jump>
            site. The license to use XML4C is simply to comply with
            the Apache license (because of Xerces-C) and IBM Public
            License (because of ICU).</p>

            <p>XML4C binaries are published for Solaris using SunWorkshop
            compiler, HPUX 10.20 and 11.0 using CC and aCC, Redhat
            Linux using gcc, Windows NT using MSVC, AIX using xlC.</p>

    <faq title="Which DLL's do I need to distribute with my application?">
        <q>Which DLL's do I need to distribute with my application?</q>
        <a>
            <p>As mentioned above, there are two configurations in
            which Xerces-C binaries are shipped. One is from the <jump
            href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">Apache
            site</jump>, while the other is from IBM
            published at <jump
            href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4c">IBM's
            Alphaworks Site</jump>.</p>

            <p>If you are using the binaries from the <jump
            href="http://xml.apache.org/dist">Apache download
            site</jump> site, then you only need to distribute
            <em>one</em> file:<br></br>

            &XercesCWindowsLib;.dll for Windows NT/95/98, or<br/>
            &XercesCUnixLib;.a for AIX, or<br/>
            &XercesCUnixLib;.so for Solaris/Linux, or<br/>
            &XercesCUnixLib;.sl for HP-UX.</p>

            <p>However, if you are using the XML4C binaries then in
            <em>addition</em> to the &XercesCName; library file
            mentioned above, you also need to ship:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em>ICU shared library file</em>:<br></br>
                    icuuc.dll for Windows NT/95/98, or<br></br>
                    libicu-uc.a for AIX, or<br></br>
                    libicu-uc.so for Solaris/Linux, or<br></br>
                    libicu-uc.sl for HP-UX.</li>

                <li><em>ICU converter data shared library file:</em><br></br>
                    icudata.dll for Windows NT/95/98, or<br></br>
                    libicudata.a for AIX, or<br></br>
                    libicudata.so for Solaris/Linux, or<br></br>
                    libicudata.sl for HP-UX.</li>

    <faq title="How do I package the sources to create a binary drop?">

        <q>How do I package the sources to create a binary drop?</q>

        <a>
            <p>You have to first compile the sources inside your IDE to
            create the required DLLs and EXEs. Then you need to copy
            over the binaries to another directory for the binary
            drop. A perl script has been provided to give you a jump
            start. You need to install perl on your machine for the script to work.
            If you have changed your source tree, you have to modify the script to suit
            your current directory structure. To invoke the
            script, go to the \&lt;&XercesCProjectName;&gt;\scripts directory, and type:</p>
<source>perl packageBinaries.pl</source>

            <p>You will get a message that somewhat looks like this (changes always happpen,
            we are evolving you see!): </p>

<source>Usage is: packageBinaries &lt;options&gt;
options are:  -s &lt;source_directory&gt;
              -o &lt;target_directory&gt;
              -c &lt;C compiler name&gt; (e.g. gcc or xlc_r)
              -x &lt;C++ compiler name&gt; (e.g. g++ or xlC_r)
              -m &lt;message loader&gt; can be 'inmem', 'icu' or 'iconv'
              -n &lt;net accessor&gt; can be 'fileonly' or 'libwww'
              -t &lt;transcoder&gt; can be 'icu' or 'native'
              -r &lt;thread option&gt; can be 'pthread' or 'dce' (only used on HP-11)
              -h to get help on these commands
Example: perl packageBinaries.pl -s$HOME/xerces-c_1_0_0
                                 -o$HOME/xerces-c_1_0_0
                                 -cgcc -xg++ -minmem
                                 -nfileonly -tnative</source>

            <p>Make sure that your compiler can be invoked from the command line and
            follow the instructions to produce a binary drop.</p>

    <faq title="I do not see binaries for my platform. When will they be available?">

        <q>I do not see binaries for my platform. When will they be available?"></q>

        <a>
            <p>The reason why you see binaries only for some specific
            platforms is that we have had the maximum requests for
            them. Moreover, we have limited resources and hence cannot
            publish binaries for every platform. If you wish to
            contribute your time and effort in building binaries for a
            specific platform/environment then please send a mail to
            <jump
            href="mailto:xerces-dev@xml.apache.org">xerces-dev@xml.apache.org</jump>.
            We can definitely use any extra help in this open source
            project</p>

    <faq title="When will a port to my platform be available?">

        <q>When will a port to my platform be available?</q>

        <a>
          <p>We would like to see &XercesCProjectName; ported to as
          many platforms as there are. Again, due to limited resources
          we cannot do all the ports. We will help you make this port
          happen. Here are some <jump
          href="http://build.html#PortingGuide">Porting
          Guidelines</jump>.</p>

            <p>We strongly encourage you to submit the changes that
            are required to make it work on another platform. We will
            incorporate these changes in the source code base and make
            them available in the future releases.</p>

            <p>All porting changes may be sent to: <jump
            href="mailto:xerces-dev@xml.apache.org">xerces-dev@xml.apache.org</jump>

        <q>What application did you used to create the documentation?</q>
        <a>
            <p>We have used an internal XML based application to create the
            documentation. The documentation files are all written in XML and the
            application, internally codenamed StyleBook, makes use of XSL to transform
            it into an HTML document that you are seeing right now.
            It is currently available on the
            <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/">Apache</jump> open source website as
            <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html">Cocoon</jump>.</p>

            <p>The API documentation is created using

    <faq title="Source code for the C++ Builder TreeViewer?">
        <q>Can I get the source code for the C++ Builder TreeViewer application?</q>
        <a>
            <p>In view of the numerous requests that we have received for
            the TreeViewer sample application (written using C++
            Builder), we have decided to make it available as an
            independent download from the IBM
            <jump href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4c/">AlphaWorks</jump>
            portal. The archive to get from the 'Download' page is
            'DOMSampleTreeViewer.zip'. Please note, this is provided on a
            "as-is, no support" basis. This sample works with XML4C 2.3.1
            and we have not verified if it works with XML4C 3.x releases.</p>

            <p>TreeViewer parses the XML file, using &XercesCProjectName;,
            and displays the data as a tree.</p>
