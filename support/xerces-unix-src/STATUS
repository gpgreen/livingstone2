This is the STATUS file for the Xerces for C++ code base. 

There are lots of things that need to be done: 

* Support for W3C XML schema.

* performance, performance, performance.  Always need help here.

* conformance, conformance, conformance.  We're pretty darn good, but
  we can always do better.

* a bunch of things that haven't been thought of yet.

* more documentation.  The docs need to be updated, especially the FAQ.

* more samples (lots, especially code fragments that accomplish specific
  tasks)

* kill bugs (always)

* Major work on the build system.
