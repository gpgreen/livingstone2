#  HP-UX with CC compiler is awkward since it does    #
#  not instantiate templates automatically. To do so  #
#  you need to invoke the linker. So, just for this   #
#  compiler, we try to create a dummy executable      #
#  before we create the shared library.  This will    #
#  force all templates to be instantiated and the     #
#  shared library is created with all template        #
#  instantiations in place.                           #

# OS/390 works pretty much the same way as Windows NT  #
# as far as linking goes. The runtime library is       #
# called .dll, and the link-time libraries have a .x   #
# extension. You need the .x files to link             #
# your application at build time and need the .dll     #
# file to run it. So, we need to copy over the .x      #
# file to the lib directory as well, so that you can   #
# link your application.                               #
