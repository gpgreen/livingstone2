/**
  * A single input source for an XML entity.
  *
  * <p>This class encapsulates information about an input source in a
  * single object, which may include a public identifier or a system
  * identifier</p>
  *
  * <p>There are two places that the application will deliver this input
  * source to the parser: as the argument to the Parser::parse method, or as
  * the return value of the EntityResolver::resolveEntity method.</p>
  *
  * <p>InputSource is never used directly, but is the base class for a number
  * of derived classes for particular types of input sources. Derivatives are
  * provided (in the internal/ directory) for URL input sources, memory buffer
  * input sources, and so on.</p>
  *
  * <p>When it is time to parse the input described by an input source, it
  * will be asked to create a binary stream for that source. That stream will
  * be used to input the data of the source. The derived class provides the
  * implementation of the makeStream() method, and provides a type of stream
  * of the correct type for the input source it represents.
  *
  * <p>An InputSource object belongs to the application: the parser never
  * modifies them in any way. They are always passed by const reference so
  * the parser will make a copy of any input sources that it must keep 
  * around beyond the call.</p>
