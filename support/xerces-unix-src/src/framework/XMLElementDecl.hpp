/**
 *  This class defines the core information of an element declaration. Each
 *  validator (DTD, Schema, etc...) will have its own information that it
 *  associations with the declaration of an element, but they must all share
 *  at least this core information, i.e. they must all derive from this
 *  class. The set of info enforced at this level is driven by the needs of
 *  XML 1.0 spec validation and well formedness checks.
 *
 *  This class supports keyed collection semantics by providing the getKey()
 *  method, which extracts the key field. getKey() just calls getFullName()
 *  which is virtual so that each type of validator can have its own version
 *  of what a full name is. For the DTD validator, its element decl
 *  derivatives will return QNames in form pre:name. A Schema validator
 *  would return expanded names in the form {uri}name.
 *
 *  This class defines some special element id values for invalid elements
 *  and PCDATA elements, as well as a string for the special PCDATA element
 *  name. All validators must honor these special values in order to allow
 *  content models to work generically (i.e. to let code know when its dealing
 *  with invalid or PCDATA element ids without having to know what type of
 *  validator its messing with.)
