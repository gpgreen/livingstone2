/*
 * $Log: BinHTTPURLInputStream.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/09/20 20:40:48  bhudson
 * Importing xerces 1.2.0
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2000/05/15 22:31:29  andyh
 * Replace #include<memory.h> with <string.h> everywhere.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/03/24 00:32:15  rahulj
 * Connect to the port specified in the URL, rather than the default one.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/03/22 00:21:10  rahulj
 * Now we throw exceptions when errors occur.
 * Simplified the code, based on the assumption that
 * the calling function will make sure that the buffer into
 * which the data has to be read is large enough.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/03/17 02:37:54  rahulj
 * First cut at adding HTTP capability via native sockets.
 * Still need to add:
 *   error handling capability, ports other than 80,
 *   escaped URL's
 * Will add options in project file only when I am done with these
 * above changes.
