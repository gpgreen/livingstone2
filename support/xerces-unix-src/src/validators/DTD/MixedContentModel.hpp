//  MixedContentModel is a derivative of the abstract content model base
//  class that handles the special case of mixed model elements. If an element
//  is mixed model, it has PCDATA as its first possible content, followed
//  by an alternation of the possible children. The children cannot have any
//  numeration or order, so it must look like this:
//
//  <!ELEMENT Foo ((#PCDATA|a|b|c|)*)>
//
//  So, all we have to do is to keep an array of the possible children and
//  validate by just looking up each child being validated by looking it up
//  in the list.
