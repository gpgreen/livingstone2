    //
    //  The first step we need to take is to rewrite the content model using
    //  our CMNode objects, and in the process get rid of any repetition short
    //  cuts, converting them into '*' style repetitions or getting rid of
    //  repetitions altogether.
    //
    //  The conversions done are:
    //
    //  x+ -> (x|x*)
    //  x? -> (x|epsilon)
    //
    //  This is a relatively complex scenario. What is happening is that we
    //  create a top level binary node of which the special EOC value is set
    //  as the right side node. The the left side is set to the rewritten
    //  syntax tree. The source is the original content model info from the
    //  decl pool. The rewrite is done by buildSyntaxTree() which recurses the
    //  decl pool's content of the element and builds a new tree in the
    //  process.
    //
    //  Note that, during this operation, we set each non-epsilon leaf node's
    //  DFA state position and count the number of such leafs, which is left
    //  in the fLeafCount member.
    //
    CMLeaf* nodeEOC = new CMLeaf(gEOCFakeId);
    CMNode* nodeOrgContent = buildSyntaxTree(fElemDecl.getContentSpec());
    fHeadNode = new CMBinaryOp
    (
        ContentSpecNode::Sequence
        , nodeOrgContent
        , nodeEOC
    );

    //
    //  And handle specially the EOC node, which also must be numbered and
    //  counted as a non-epsilon leaf node. It could not be handled in the
    //  above tree build because it was created before all that started. We
    //  save the EOC position since its used during the DFA building loop.
    //
    fEOCPos = fLeafCount;
    nodeEOC->setPosition(fLeafCount++);

    //
    //  Ok, so now we have to iterate the new tree and do a little more work
    //  now that we know the leaf count. One thing we need to do is to
    //  calculate the first and last position sets of each node. This is
    //  cached away in each of the nodes.
    //
    //  Along the way we also set the leaf count in each node as the maximum
    //  state count. They must know this in order to create their first/last
    //  position sets.
    //
    //  We also need to build an array of references to the non-epsilon
    //  leaf nodes. Since we iterate here the same way as we did during the
    //  initial tree build (which built their position numbers, we will put
    //  them in the array according to their position values.
    //
    fLeafList = new CMLeaf*[fLeafCount];
    postTreeBuildInit(fHeadNode, 0);

    //
    //  And, moving onward... We now need to build the follow position sets
    //  for all the nodes. So we allocate an array of pointers to state sets,
    //  one for each leaf node (i.e. each significant DFA position.)
    //

    //  ambiguous flag member and keep going.

    //  Check to see whether this content model can handle an empty content,
    //  which is something we need to optimize by looking now before we
    //  throw away the info that would tell us that.
    //
    //  If the left node of the head (the top level of the original content)
    //  is nullable, then its true.
    //
    fEmptyOk = nodeOrgContent->isNullable();

    //
    //  And finally the big push... Now we build the DFA using all the states
    //  and the tree we've built up. First we set up the various data
    //  structures we are going to use while we do this.
    //
    //  First of all we need an array of unique element ids in our content
    //  model. For each transition table entry, we need a set of contiguous
    //  indices to represent the transitions for a particular input element.
    //  So we need to a zero based range of indexes that map to element types.
    //  This element map provides that mapping.
    //
