 * $Log: DeepNodeListImpl.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/09/20 20:40:16  bhudson
 * Importing xerces 1.2.0
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2000/04/27 02:52:42  lehors
 * global reorganization similar to what I've done in Java,
 * nodes now are much smaller.
 * The main changes are:
 * renamed NodeContainer to ParentNode,
 * introduced ChildNode and ChildAndParentNode,
 * all the boolean attributes have been changed to bit flags,
 * ownerDocument is no longer an attribute of NodeImpl, only Parent nodes have
 * it, leave nodes rely on their parent to get it, or get it from ownerNode when
 * they do not have a parent,
 * parent Nodes no longer have a direct pointer to the last child
 * instead the last child is stored as the previous sibling of
 * the first child.
 * I also added support for importing a DocumentType as it's done in Java,
 * and got the importNode mechanism back in sync with Java as well.
 *
 * Here are the most significant changes in size:
 * ElementImpl 52 -> 48
 * TextImpl    44 -> 32
 * AttrImpl    52 -> 36
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2000/03/02 19:53:59  roddey
 * This checkin includes many changes done while waiting for the
 * 1.1.0 code to be finished. I can't list them all here, but a list is
 * available elsewhere.
