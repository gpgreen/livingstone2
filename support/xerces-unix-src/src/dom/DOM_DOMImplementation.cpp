 * $Log: DOM_DOMImplementation.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/09/20 20:40:19  bhudson
 * Importing xerces 1.2.0
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2000/05/09 00:22:31  andyh
 * Memory Cleanup.  XMLPlatformUtils::Terminate() deletes all lazily
 * allocated memory; memory leak checking tools will no longer report
 * that leaks exist.  (DOM GetElementsByTagID temporarily removed
 * as part of this.)
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2000/04/27 02:52:42  lehors
 * global reorganization similar to what I've done in Java,
 * nodes now are much smaller.
 * The main changes are:
 * renamed NodeContainer to ParentNode,
 * introduced ChildNode and ChildAndParentNode,
 * all the boolean attributes have been changed to bit flags,
 * ownerDocument is no longer an attribute of NodeImpl, only Parent nodes have
 * it, leave nodes rely on their parent to get it, or get it from ownerNode when
 * they do not have a parent,
 * parent Nodes no longer have a direct pointer to the last child
 * instead the last child is stored as the previous sibling of
 * the first child.
 * I also added support for importing a DocumentType as it's done in Java,
 * and got the importNode mechanism back in sync with Java as well.
 *
 * Here are the most significant changes in size:
 * ElementImpl 52 -> 48
 * TextImpl    44 -> 32
 * AttrImpl    52 -> 36
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2000/03/02 19:53:54  roddey
 * This checkin includes many changes done while waiting for the
 * 1.1.0 code to be finished. I can't list them all here, but a list is
 * available elsewhere.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2000/02/10 23:35:10  andyh
 * Update DOM_DOMImplementation::CreateDocumentType and
 * DOM_DocumentType to match latest from W3C
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2000/02/06 07:47:28  rahulj
 * Year 2K copyright swat.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2000/01/19 21:39:19  andyh
 * DOM L2, fix problems with new style createDocument.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/01/05 01:16:07  andyh
 * DOM Level 2 core, namespace support added.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/11/30 21:16:25  roddey
 * Changes to add the transcode() method to DOMString, which returns a transcoded
 * version (to local code page) of the DOM string contents. And I changed all of the
 * exception 'throw by pointer' to 'throw by value' style.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/11/09 01:08:56  twl
 * Initial checkin
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1999/11/08 20:44:15  rahul
 * Swat for adding in Product name and CVS comment log variable.
