Organization
============

I decided to put all the code into one file, and have all the commands that
you actually run be links to the one perl script.  This of course makes
running a very cheap script rather more expensive, but it's plenty fast
enough so I don't care.

All the code is in common.in ; don't edit common as it's generated from
common.in.  The only thing I generate is the location of the perl
executable; it changes between linux and sun (sigh!)

Because of this, remember to 'make' when hacking common.in -- otherwise,
you'll have the frustrating result of no changes happening.


Data Structures
===============

The scripts use plenty of complex (and confusing) data structures,
including almost every combination you could think of nesting 3 types of
lists and hashes.  See the description at the top of common.in

I turn on the -w flag, and use strict, in order to avoid some nasty bugs
related to these nasty data structures.  Leave those there.
