        Removed cover tests from checkin/quick testing, since they all fail
        currently.  This should be fixed ASAP.  Also reorganized the
        testlist so it's easy to reinstate them, and also remove others
        later.
        * testlist (group cb): now just includes cb-cbfs, cb-cover, and
                    cb-stripped (except cb-cover is commented out)
                (cb-cbfs, cb-cover): resp. cbfs and cover tests that used
                    to comprise group cb; name removes any mention of cb or
                    search style since they're now in the group name
                (group cbfs): use all of cb-cbfs instead of just some of cb
                (group cover): use all of cb-cover instead of just some of cb
                (group quick): updated name: cb.cbfs- becomes cb-cbfs.
                (group checkin): added quick, cbfs, cover (except cover
                        is commented out)

        This changed the names of tests, so I moved all the base files
        over from the old names to the new according to:
                s/^cb\(.*\)cover-/cb-cover\1/
                s/^cb\(.*\)cbfs-/cb-cbfs\1/
        Except for cb.truncate-visibility which just gains a '-cbfs'.

	* base/cb.cbfs-5-1000-0.out base/cb.cbfs-5-1000-2.out
	  base/cb.cbfs-min-5-1000-0.out base/cb.cbfs-min-5-1000-2.out

	  base/cb.dt2-cover-10-2.out base/cb.truncate-visibility.out : removed

        * base/cb-cbfs.5-1000-0.out base/cb-cbfs.5-1000-2.out
	  base/cb-cbfs.min-5-1000-0.out base/cb-cbfs.min-5-1000-2.out

2001-07-19  Benoit Hudson  <bhudson@arc.nasa.gov>
        Further update; don't run tests twice.
        * scripts/common.in (test definition): added 'inlist'
                (addtest): added
                (loop over @ARGV): use addtest

2001-07-19  Benoit Hudson  <bhudson@arc.nasa.gov>
        Updated regression tests ; this adds:
                - no makefiles ==> no need to 'touch configure'
                - hide 'common' ==> no confused users
                - global settings
                - groups can use other groups and tests
                - the scripts can refer to single tests
        * configure.in (AC_INIT): look for scripts/common.in
                (AC_OUTPUT): moved common to scripts/, added
                        scripts/make_links, run scripts/make_links
        * configure : regenerated
        * Makefile.in common.in : removed
        * scripts/common.in scripts/make_links.in : added
        * doc/BUILD : removed discussion of make and touch
        * testlist (comments): added discussion of where settings come
                        from, new 'global' settings, some to-dos ;
                (global): added section
                (all groups): removed exec and subs (they're now global)
                (groups cbfs, cover, quick, checkin): added

                note I can't explain the real cb.cover-10-2 right now,
                so I updated the numbers but not the rest to make sure it

                (cover-min-10-0, cover-min-10-2): added

                at the first timestep anymore (does min instead)

2001-01-16  Benoit Hudson  <bhudson@arc.nasa.gov>

        * base/cb.truncate-visibility.out : updated (one less timestep,
                which is either an implementation or doc bug)

                in all others to be called time#state.
