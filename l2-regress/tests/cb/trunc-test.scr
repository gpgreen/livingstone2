// A test of the truncation algorithm.
// Just for the easiest stuff: idle everything until we automatically
// truncate a few times; then truncate by hand; then truncate again, but
// a timestep that no longer exists.

// We run with a history of 3.

// we have a history depth of 2 after this
progress
oldest-time

// we have a history depth of 3 after this

// cause an automatic truncate

// make sure it worked: oldest-time should be 1

// truncate the same again
