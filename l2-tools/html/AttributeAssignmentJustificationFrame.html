<b>How to use the Justification Tool</b>
<p><b><i>The Explanation View</i></b>
<p>The upper pane contains a description of why Livingstone assigned a
value to a particular model attribute.&nbsp; This summary is either in
terms of an outline (a JTree) or a diagram (a Lattice).&nbsp; Within the
outline or diagram, individual assignments look like this:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;time>#&lt;attributeName>=&lt;value></tt></blockquote>
Assignments are connected to each other by chains of reasoning, i.e., if
Livingstone believed <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>, then it could conclude
<tt>Z</tt>.&nbsp; We say belief in <tt>Z</tt> is <i>justified</i> by belief
in <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>.
<p>&lt;more here about the direction of inference>

<p><b><i>The Selected Assignment View</i></b>
<p>&lt;not available yet>
<p>The bottom pane contains a description of whatever has been selected
in the upper pane.&nbsp; Usually this will explain how Livingstone inferred
the selected assignment from other assignments immediately preceding it
in Livingstone's chain of reasoning.
